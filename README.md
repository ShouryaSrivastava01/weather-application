# First Contribution

If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://weather-application.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://weather-application.github.io/assets/Readme/clone1.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/weather-application.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd weather-application
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b updating-the-app
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open the files you want to update and continue to update everything. Save all the files.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

for adding all changes execute the command below:
```
git add .
```

for adding one file execute the command below with <relative-file-path> as the path of the file you updated:
```
git add <relative-file-path>
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Short description of the changes you made"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin -u <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.
